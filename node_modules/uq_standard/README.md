# UQ Standard Theme
This theme is the base theme for all UQ branded websites. 

This theme is to be used as a base for official UQ subthemes and/or site specific themes and provides:

* a global UQ header and footer
* global navigation
* base styles for all HTML elements
* references to centrally managed corporate font and icon repositories
* Corporate brand colours

UQ Standard should not be used for custom site designs that are not based on UQ branding.

# CSS Standard

Anyone who is contributing to the theme should read the [CSS Standard](https://git.its.uq.edu.au/uq-drupal/uq_standard/blob/dev/CSS_Standards.md)
before committing any code.

Any merge request didn't pass the [lint test](#lint-test) will not be merged.

# Setup instructions

This theme is recommended for use with the centrally managed [Drupal VM](http://drupal.uq.edu.au/guide/developers).

## Prerequisites

Download and install: 
* [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Ruby 1.9+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or [RubyInstaller for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install)

**Install Compass**  
Open a command prompt and run: 
`
 $ gem update --system
 $ gem install compass
 $ gem install breakpoint
 $ gem install sass-globbing
`

**Install Gulp**  
Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to your theme's root directory and run: 
`npm install -g gulp` - This installs all the necessary Gulp plugins to help with task automation such as Sass compiling and browser-sync. 

**Install Bower**  
In the command prompt/terminal and run: 
`npm install -g bower` - This installs [Bower](http://bower.io) (the -g flag installs globally, not just in the current directory)

**Install Composer**  
[Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally) globally, so that it will be available in your other projects.

**Install BlessCSS**  
`npm install bless -g` - This installs [BlessCSS](http://blesscss.com/)

**Install Dependencies**  
There are SASS and JS packages that are required. To install the necessary packages run: 
`bower install` - This will install the theme's dependencies such as Zurb Foundation and other external libraries.

* This installs [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and dependencies jQuery, several libraries and Modernizr.

**Generate Compiled CSS**  
Run `compass watch` in the theme folder

For full testing, make sure the following are installed:  
`npm install grunt-bless --save-dev`  
`npm install grunt-contrib-compass --save-dev`  
`npm install grunt-pixrem --save-dev`  

Run `grunt` which will compile css, pixrem convert, and blesscss split files for IE support.

### IE9 support
IE9 doesn't support rem units or more than 4094 selectors per css file. To overcome this we use a rem-to-px script, and 
BlessCSS (http://blesscss.com/) to split selectors into separate files.

Run Bless manually: `$ blessc css/styles.css -f`

# Lint test

[Grunt Sass lint](https://github.com/sasstools/grunt-sass-lint) is used to run the lint test for stylesheets. Run ```grunt``` to generate a lint test report in /scss/lint-report.xml file.

[Click here](https://git.its.uq.edu.au/uq-drupal/uq_standard/blob/dev/CSS_Standards.md) to read the recommended styling practise to pass the lint test.

# Icons
Includes the [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) icon set, and the [UQ Icons](fonts/uq-icons/README.md) custom icon font.
