Notes
-----
1. The text in red (from the class 'text-placeholder')is just a placeholder and not the style. Remove the class in the final build.

2. The sentence beginning with 'Single Notice', 'Multiple Notices' before notices are just for understanding what the notices are meant for and should be removed in the final build.

3. In case of Single notices the 'Remind me later' button remains within the respective notice, whereas in the case of Multiple notices, it is moved out of the notice to the very bottom of all the notices.
